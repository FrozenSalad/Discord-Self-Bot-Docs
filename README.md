# Discord.py-self Beginner Ground Docs

## Introduction

My very own documentation for beginners trying to learn about self botting, as said in the title, this is a beginner ground so it doesn't cover anything that isn't directly correlated to discord.py-self

- **Discord Self-Bots are indeed against TOS, it may risk your account getting banned**
    - *I am not responsible if you're account gets banned, please don't come after me if it does please :3*

- **This documentation may not be what you're looking for, but it includes further examples from the already made [discord.py-self documenation](https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io), class explanations and their attributes, and parameter usage**
    - *In terms of classes, attributes types that are **bools**, **str**, or **int** are skipped due to their simplicity*


*Python is probably one of the closest programming languages to English, and discord.py-self has the best of it, so it's much easier to decipher from an understanding standpoint*
